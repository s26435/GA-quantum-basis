# Genethic Algorithm for optimizing number of exponents in Quantum Chemistry Bases

## Files
1. `main.py` - entry point for app - `python3 main.py` to run
2. `build_input.py` - file contains program that builds new input file based on json input, used by main in concurent jobs
3. `parse_energy.py` - file contains program that extracts energy value from molcas output file, used by main in concurent jobs
4. `requirements.txt` - contains required libs for app to work
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5. `analyze.py` - script for generating metric visualization based on `metrics.csv`
6. `cleanup.sh` - file that <u>DELETES</u> all files created by app

## Files and directories created by app
1. `metrics.csv` - contains basic metrics from training:
    * generation number
    * `generator_loss` - loss of Population Generator - not realy usefull becouse its often fluctuates 
    * `gen_non_penalty_rate` - fraction of good genomes generated by Population Generator 
    * `ga_non_penalty_rate` - fraction of good genome in whole population
    * `best_fit` - value of <u> fitness function</u> of best genome
    * `mean_fit` - mean value of fitness function for whole population
    * `average_length` - average length of genomes in population
    * `best_energy` - value of <u>energy</u> of best genome
    * `error` - error value of best genome: $\text{err} = |E_{\text{ground truth}} - E_{\text{calculated}}|$
    * `lr` - learning rate of Population Generator

2. `populations.csv` - contains exponents, masks, fitness function values and energy value of every genome in every population created during trianing
3. `out.log` - contains logs form training
4. `cache/energy.sqlite` - SQLite databse used to caching energy values
5. `model.ckpt` - Population Generator checkopint file
6. `gen_****/` - folders that contains all population's output files from molcas, json input files and INPUT files ready for use
